## 🐞 Tips & Tricks
*   **Shiny Pokemon**: Every time a game starts, there is a 5% chance a piece will be Shiny (sparkling and different color). If you own the **Shiny Charm**, this chance jumps to 25%!
*   **Chat**: In AI mode, you can chat with the Rival. Try asking them why they made a move, or taunt them!
*   **Streaks**: Winning 3 games in a row sets your board "On Fire", giving it a special visual glow.
